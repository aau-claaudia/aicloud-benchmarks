This directory holds an emtpy pytorch_23.10.sif file. This is just to demonstrate the expected location.
To obtain the container, run: `srun --mem 40G singularity pull docker://nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.10-py3`

Do also pay attention to the expected output directories in the scripts. This location should exist before running.
